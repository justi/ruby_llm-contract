# Changelog

## 0.10.1 (2026-06-01)

Patch release fixing gem packaging. 0.10.0 was yanked from rubygems.org due to the issue documented below; 0.10.1 is the recommended upgrade target. No code behavior change vs 0.10.0.

### Fixed

- **Gem no longer ships internal tracker / dev configs.** Excluded from `spec.files`: `TODO.md`, `.rspec`, `.rubycritic.yml`, `.simplecov`, and the `.revive/` directory. Pre-0.10.1 the published gem contained these files; adopters who already extracted 0.10.0 can safely delete them.

## 0.10.0 (2026-06-01)

First published release since 0.8.0. Consolidates work originally tagged as 0.9.0 (multimodal input) and 0.9.1 (internal quality refactor), neither of which was pushed to rubygems. Adopters upgrading from 0.8.0 should read the **Behavioural change** and **Breaking changes** sections below before installing.

### Breaking changes

- **`validate(description, &block)` and `Definition#invariant(description, &block)` now raise `ArgumentError` when `description` is `nil` or empty.** Pre-0.10.0 the empty descriptor was silently accepted and produced `""` entries in `result.validation_errors`, making debugging impossible. Codex audit found zero production use sites across `lib/`, `examples/`, `README` — only the regression-marker test certifying the bug.

### Migration

Ensure every `validate` / `invariant` call has a non-empty descriptor (this is already how every README example writes them):

```ruby
# Before (silently accepted, produced "" in validation_errors):
validate("") { |o| o[:score].between?(0, 100) }

# After (required):
validate("score in range 0-100") { |o| o[:score].between?(0, 100) }
```

### Added

- **Multimodal input via `context: { attachment: ... }`** — pass a file/IO/URL through `Step.run(input, context: { attachment: path })`; the adapter forwards it to `RubyLLM::Chat#ask(content, with: attachment)`. RubyLLM normalises wire format per provider (Anthropic url/base64, OpenAI `image_url`/`file`, Gemini `inline_data`). Multi-attachment supported natively (`with: [pdf1, pdf2]` or `with: { images: [...], pdfs: [...] }`). See [multimodal input guide](docs/guide/multimodal_input.md) and [ADR-0022](doc/decisions/ADR-0022-v09-multimodal-input.md).
- **`attachment_token_estimate(n)` class macro** — adopter-declared conservative estimate of attachment input tokens. Applied to BOTH runtime (`limit_checker`) and pre-flight (`estimate_cost`) — same source of truth, no estimate/runtime drift.
- **`on_unknown_attachment_size(:refuse | :warn)` class macro** — mirrors `on_unknown_pricing` opt-out semantics. Defaults to `:refuse`. Never settable as global default — same invariant as `max_cost` fail-closed.

### Behavioural change (READ BEFORE UPGRADING)

- **Contracts with `max_cost` or `max_input` AND `context[:attachment]` set AND no `attachment_token_estimate` declared → REFUSE with `:limit_exceeded`.** This is fail-closed semantics: the gem cannot bound vision/PDF token cost without an adopter-declared estimate. Opt out per-step with `on_unknown_attachment_size :warn`. Text-only contracts and contracts without `max_cost`/`max_input` are unaffected.

### Changed

- **`run_eval` (no args) return shape pinned to `Hash<String, Report>` keyed by eval name.** Documents the existing contract used by `RubyLLM::Contract::RakeTask#collect_host_reports` and adopters. No runtime change vs 0.8.0 — only the spec assertion now locks the shape.
- **`Parser.parse(text, strategy: :json)` first-bracket-wins boundary documented.** Extraction commits to the first balanced `{` or `[` structure and does NOT retry on later candidates. Empty `{}` followed by real JSON parses as the empty Hash; non-JSON `{braces}` before real JSON raises `ParseError`. No runtime change — this codifies long-standing behavior with explicit boundary tests.

### Fixed

- **`with_retry_disabled` no longer mutates the step class's singleton method.** The optimizer now passes `retry_policy_override: nil` through `context:` to `compare_models`, which `Step::Base#runtime_settings` already honours. Removes a concurrency hazard where two parallel `optimize_retry_policy` calls on the same step would race on the singleton restore in `ensure`.
- **`CostCalculator.find_model` exposed as a public class method.** Removes two `CostCalculator.send(:find_model, ...)` workarounds in `Step::Base#estimate_cost`. The `estimated_cost_for` helper is gone — `estimate_cost` now routes through the existing public `CostCalculator.calculate(model_name:, usage:)`.
- **`stub_step` unified on a single storage path.** Both block and non-block forms now write to `RubyLLM::Contract.step_adapter_overrides` (thread-local). The `around(:each)` hook in `rspec.rb` handles cleanup between examples. Removes the prior `allow(step).to receive(:run)` branch.

### Internal

- **Anti-facade audit complete: 89/89 spec files under per-test 17-mode walk** (Phase A: 26 specs, Phase C: 63 specs via parallel Codex fan-out). Net +30 strengthened tests against mutation-blind assertions, zero public API change beyond the breaking entry above.
- **Dead `ObjectSpace.each_object(Class)` fallback removed** in `concerns/eval_host.rb#register_subclasses`. The gemspec requires Ruby `>= 3.2.0`, so `Class#subclasses` (Ruby ≥ 3.1) is always available; the legacy fallback was unreachable code that would have iterated all loaded classes O(n) and was not thread-safe.

### Deferred (not in 0.10.x)

- `add_history` multi-turn replay of prior attachments — single-turn multimodal supported; follow-up questions on the same document deferred to a later release.
- Streaming + attachment — contract steps remain synchronous.
- Provider-specific attachment size caps — surface only via `attachment_token_estimate` calibration; consult provider docs.

### Tests

- Suite: 1401 examples / 0 failures / 7 pending (was 1346/0/8 at 0.8.0).

## 0.8.0 (2026-04-26)

Narrative repositioning + small API additions. Internal architecture unchanged: no `Step::Base` refactor, no breaking changes to existing DSL.

### Added

- **`thinking(effort:, budget:)` class macro on `Step::Base`** — mirrors `RubyLLM::Agent.thinking` signature exactly. Stored as `{ effort:, budget: }` hash; reader returns the hash; supports `:default` reset semantics; superclass inheritance like `model`/`temperature`. The convenience alias `reasoning_effort(:low)` is implemented as `thinking(effort: :low)` — single normalized state, not separate ivar.
- **Adapter wiring for `with_thinking`** — when `thinking` is set on the Step class, OR when `reasoning_effort:` is passed through context, OR when an attempt config in `retry_policy escalate(...)` carries `reasoning_effort:`, the RubyLLM adapter resolves the effective `{ effort:, budget: }` hash and forwards it via `chat.with_thinking(**)` — provider-agnostic (supports OpenAI `reasoning_effort` AND Anthropic extended-thinking budget). Precedence: per-attempt / context `reasoning_effort` overrides class-level `thinking[:effort]`; budget is taken from class-level `thinking[:budget]`. **Behavioural change vs 0.7.x**: `reasoning_effort` is now forwarded via `with_thinking` instead of `with_params`. Same wire-level OpenAI parameter; provider-agnostic Anthropic support is now automatic.

### Dependencies

- **`ruby_llm` constraint bumped from `~> 1.0` to `~> 1.12`** — `Chat#with_thinking` is the canonical path for reasoning effort + extended thinking; it shipped in RubyLLM 1.12. Adopters on `ruby_llm < 1.12` need to bump RubyLLM before upgrading this gem to 0.8.0.

### Changed

- **Tagline + README opening** — repositioned around "Contracts + Evals for RubyLLM". New "Relation to RubyLLM::Agent" section explicitly frames Step as a sibling abstraction (same niche as Agent, wider contract), not an alternative or foundation. README does not claim "Step uses Agent under the hood" — current call path is `Step → Runner → Adapters::RubyLLM → RubyLLM.chat` directly.
- **`TokenEstimator` documented as heuristic** — module docstring expanded with explicit "±30% accuracy" framing. Refusal messages from `LimitChecker` now include `(heuristic ±30%)` suffix so adopters know the pre-flight number is estimated, not measured. RubyLLM 1.14 also has no pre-flight tokenizer; `RubyLLM::Tokens` is post-hoc only.
- **`CostCalculator` repositioned in docs** — module narrative reframed from "cost calculator" to "fine-tune pricing registry + lookup with fallback chain". Math methods (`compute_cost`, `token_cost`, etc.) were already private; this release makes the docs match. Public API surface unchanged: `register_model`, `unregister_model`, `reset_custom_models!`, `calculate`.
- **`output_schema` reframed in docs** — described as "wrapper around `RubyLLM::Schema` + client-side validation step", not a standalone feature. The schema language is identical to what `RubyLLM::Agent.schema` accepts; the difference is what wraps it.
- **README retry framing** — `retry_policy escalate(...)` (model escalation on validation failure) is the marketed default. `retry_policy attempts: N` (same-model retry) stays in the API for backward compat and niche cases (subjective criteria, multi-step pipelines, weaker models) but is no longer marketed as a recommended default. Empirical basis: four small experiments across PDF quiz generation, GSM8K math (n=30 + n=120), and multi-constraint schedule generation found no useful lift for nano-class models on tasks with clear correctness criteria.

### Documentation

- **New disambiguation paragraphs** in `prompt_ast.md` (`Step.input_type` vs `RubyLLM::Agent.inputs`; `Prompt::Builder` multi-role DSL vs Agent ERB single-string template loader), `testing.md` (`Step.observe` vs `Chat#on_end_message` / `on_tool_call`), `output_schema.md` (relation to `Agent.schema`), and `optimizing_retry_policy.md` (orthogonal model + thinking dimensions).
- **`getting_started.md` refusal message example** updated to include the new `(heuristic ±30%)` suffix.

### Issues closed

- **#11** (Optimizer is blind to same-model attempts) — closed after empirical experiments. `attempts: N` retry stays in API; not marketed as a default.
- **#6** (Production cost reporting) — already implemented in 0.7.x; close confirmed.

### Not in this release (deferred)

- `output_schema` Proc form for runtime-input-aware schemas (parity with `Agent.schema` Proc form). Additive, low-risk; deferred to 0.9 to keep 0.8 scope tight.
- H4 (Step composing `RubyLLM::Agent` internally as config holder) — verified feasible but ROI insufficient for current adopter base; trigger-based revisit, no calendar commitment.

## 0.7.3 (2026-04-24)

Adoption-friction release. No runtime behavior changes — every delta is in `docs/`, `examples/`, or `spec/integration/` (plus the `version.rb` / Gemfile.lock bumps). Upgrading from 0.7.2 picks up the expanded guide set, the new runnable showcases, and one extra integration spec.

### Documentation

- **New guide: `docs/guide/why.md`** — four production failure modes the gem exists for (schema-valid logically wrong, silent prompt regression, sampling variance on fixed-temperature models, runaway cost). Opens from a concrete incident each time; designed for readers who have not yet felt the pain the gem relieves.
- **New guide: `docs/guide/rails_integration.md`** — seven Rails-specific FAQs with runnable snippets: where step classes live (`app/contracts/`), initializer setup, background jobs, `around_call` observability, RSpec/Minitest stubs, error handling in controllers, CI gate wiring.
- **README adoption-friction pass** — added a short "Do I need this?" block after Install, a reading-order hint (`README → why.md → getting_started.md`), and outcome-based labels in the docs index ("Prevent silent prompt regressions" instead of "Eval-First", etc.).
- **TL;DR box at the top of every guide** — single-sentence orientation for readers who land via search; "Skip if" clause added where real confusion exists (`eval_first.md`, `testing.md`, `migration.md`).
- **API coverage gaps closed** — `estimate_cost` / `estimate_eval_cost`, `max_cost on_unknown_pricing: :warn`, `run_eval(..., concurrency:)`, `around_call` testing patterns now documented in `getting_started.md`, `eval_first.md`, `testing.md`.
- **Industry-standard terminology** — `temperature-locked` → `fixed-temperature`, `variance-induced` → `sampling variance`, `severity signals` → `severity keywords`, `takeaway drift` → `tone/takeaways mismatch`.
- **`docs/architecture.md` refresh** — diagram now reflects the current class layout: added `Step::RetryPolicy`, `Pipeline::Result`, `Eval::AggregatedReport`, `Eval::BaselineDiff`, `Eval::PromptDiffComparator`, `Eval::EvalHistory`, `Eval::RetryOptimizer`, `OptimizeRakeTask`. Replaced the outdated `Eval::TraitEvaluator` entry with `Eval::ExpectationEvaluator`.
- **Business framing added to guides** — every guide opens with a concrete production scenario or "why it matters" hook before the API reference.

### Examples — consolidated on `SummarizeArticle`, renumbered 00-06

The previous 12-file set mixed a private Reddit promo planner, customer support, meetings, keyword extraction, and translation. The new set is seven runnable files, each answering one adopter question on the README's `SummarizeArticle` case.

| # | File | Answers |
|---|------|---------|
| 00 | `00_basics.rb` | How do I start? (seven incremental layers + real-LLM pointer) |
| 01 | `01_fallback_showcase.rb` | Show me the gem in 30 seconds (zero API keys) |
| 02 | `02_real_llm_minimal.rb` | How do I plug in a real LLM? (~30 lines) |
| 03 | `03_summarize_with_keywords.rb` | How does the contract evolve? (growing prompt) |
| 04 | `04_summarize_and_translate.rb` | Pipeline composition + pipeline-level `run_eval` |
| 05 | `05_eval_dataset.rb` | How do I stop silent prompt regressions? |
| 06 | `06_retry_variants.rb` | `attempts: 3`, `reasoning_effort` escalation, cross-provider (Ollama → Anthropic → OpenAI) |

Every file carries an "Expected output" block in its header so readers see the result without running the script. The `docs/ideas/` directory is now fully untracked (already in `.gitignore`; one stray file removed from version control).

### Examples — bug fixes carried along

- **Schema pitfall fixed in 5 files** — `array :x do; string :y; ...; end` silently produces `items: string` and drops every declaration after the first, matching the documented pitfall in `spec/ruby_llm/contract/nested_schema_spec.rb:71`. Every affected array block is now wrapped in `object do...end`.
- **`examples/05_eval_dataset.rb` (pre-renumber: `09_eval_dataset.rb`) `result[:passed]` → `result.passed?`** — the previous code called `[]` on an `Eval::CaseResult` and raised `NoMethodError` at runtime.

### Testing

- **New `spec/integration/pipeline_eval_spec.rb`** — three cases guaranteeing pipeline-level `run_eval` stays functional: happy path, final-step mismatch, and fail-fast propagation when an intermediate `validate` rejects. Closes the "09 STEP 5 pipeline evaluation" known issue flagged in the 0.7.2 release. The fail-fast case asserts `step_status == :validation_failed` and the validate's label in `details`, so a regression that short-circuits on schema instead of validate would fail loudly.

### Deleted (private-project cleanup)

- `examples/01_classify_threads.rb`, `02_generate_comment.rb`, `03_target_audience.rb`, `10_reddit_full_showcase.rb`, `spec/integration/reddit_pipeline_spec.rb` — Reddit Promo Planner was a separate private project; its examples do not belong in the gem's public repo.
- `examples/02_output_schema.rb` — fully covered by `docs/guide/output_schema.md`; deleting avoids duplication.

## 0.7.2 (2026-04-22)

### Changed

- **Terminal output labels renamed for consistency with README narrative.** `print_summary` now prints `Hardest eval` (was `Constraining eval`), `Suggested fallback list` (was `Suggested chain`), and the production-mode table uses `first-attempt` / `fallback %` as column headers (was `single-shot` / `escalation`). Programmatic metric names unchanged: `single_shot_cost`, `single_shot_latency_ms`, `escalation_rate`. `RetryOptimizer::Result` exposes `hardest_eval` as an alias for `constraining_eval`.

### Documentation

- **`docs/guide/optimizing_retry_policy.md` rewritten** — 17.7k → 6.4k characters. Continues the `SummarizeArticle` narrative from README. Offline mode clearly positioned as wiring-check; real optimization runs via `LIVE=1 RUNS=3`. Output samples match actual `print_summary` format.
- **`docs/guide/getting_started.md` rewritten** — 8.7k → 6.1k. Every example uses `SummarizeArticle`. Evals + CI gates section moved before Budget caps. Structured Prompts / Dynamic Prompts / "Already using ruby_llm?" / Reasoning effort sections removed; content delegated to `prompt_ast.md` and README.
- **`docs/guide/eval_first.md` refined** — 6.3k → 5.0k. Switched to `SummarizeArticle` case. Team workflow section compressed with links back to `getting_started.md` for the matcher chain.
- **`docs/guide/testing.md` refined** — 10.7k → 7.4k. Switched to `SummarizeArticle` case. Threshold gating / Rake task / baseline walkthrough / prompt A/B sections delegated back to `getting_started.md` and `eval_first.md`.
- **`docs/guide/output_schema.md` DSL bug fix** — the Supported constraints table documented JSON Schema camelCase keys (`minLength`, `minItems`, `additionalProperties`) that are not valid DSL arguments. Every copy-paste from the previous table would have raised `ArgumentError`. Switched to snake_case (`min_length`, `min_items`, `additional_properties`) as the DSL actually expects; added a short note on the internal camelCase conversion.
- **`docs/guide/best_practices.md`, `pipeline.md`, `migration.md` sanity pass** — terminology alignment (model escalation → model fallback where narrative; `escalate` DSL method unchanged) and `SummarizeArticle` case where the guide is not inherently multi-step.

## 0.7.1 (2026-04-22)

### Changed (behavioral, follow-up to v0.7.0)

- **`Step::Base#run_once` no longer swallows adapter-phase `ArgumentError` as `:input_error`.** The previous blanket `rescue ArgumentError` was there to convert DSL misconfiguration (e.g. missing `prompt`) into an `:input_error` Result. Side effect: programmer bugs in adapter code that raised `ArgumentError` (wrong arity, bad config argument) were silently coerced into `:input_error` and retried as if the user had given bad input. Now the rescue is narrowed to the Runner-construction phase only — DSL configuration errors still produce `:input_error` (the `prompt has not been set` case is regression-tested), but `ArgumentError` raised from adapter code during `Runner#call` propagates to the caller. Input-type validation failures continue to produce `:input_error` through `InputValidator`'s own scoped rescue, unchanged.

## 0.7.0 (2026-04-21)

### Breaking changes

- **`:adapter_error` removed from `DEFAULT_RETRY_ON`.** New default: `[:validation_failed, :parse_error]`. `ruby_llm` already retries transport errors (`RateLimitError`, `ServerError`, `ServiceUnavailableError`, `OverloadedError`, timeouts) at the Faraday layer, so the previous default re-ran the same model on errors the HTTP middleware already retried with backoff. To restore pre-0.7 behavior: `retry_on :validation_failed, :parse_error, :adapter_error`. Recommended pattern: pair `:adapter_error` with `escalate "model_a", "model_b"` — a different model/provider can bypass what transport retry could not.
- **`AdapterCaller` narrows `rescue` from `StandardError` to `RubyLLM::Error` + `Faraday::Error`.** Provider errors and transport errors that escape ruby_llm's Faraday retry middleware (`Faraday::TimeoutError`, `Faraday::ConnectionFailed`) still produce `:adapter_error` as before. Programmer errors that are neither (`NoMethodError`, adapter code bugs) now propagate instead of being silently converted to `:adapter_error` and retried. **Known limitation:** adapter code raising `ArgumentError` is still coerced into `:input_error` by `Step::Base#run_once` (which rescues `ArgumentError` for input-type validation). Disambiguating adapter-ArgumentError vs input-validation-ArgumentError requires a `run_once` refactor and is tracked as a follow-up.

### Migration

If you rely on the old behavior, opt in explicitly:

```ruby
retry_policy do
  attempts 3
  retry_on :validation_failed, :parse_error, :adapter_error
end
```

Or better, with a model fallback chain:

```ruby
retry_policy do
  escalate "gpt-4.1-nano", "gpt-4.1-mini"
  retry_on :validation_failed, :parse_error, :adapter_error
end
```

## 0.6.4 (2026-04-20)

### Features

- **`production_mode:` on `compare_models` and `optimize_retry_policy`** — measures retry-aware, end-to-end cost per successful output. Pass `production_mode: { fallback: "gpt-5-mini" }` and each candidate runs with a runtime-injected `[candidate, fallback]` retry chain. The report exposes `escalation_rate`, `single_shot_cost`, and `effective_cost` so "the cheaper candidate" decision matches production cost rather than first-attempt cost.
- **New Report metrics** — `escalation_rate`, `single_shot_cost`, `effective_cost`, `single_shot_latency_ms`, `effective_latency_ms`, `latency_percentiles` (p50/p95/max). `AggregatedReport` averages all of them across `runs:`.
- **Extended `ModelComparison#table`** — when `production_mode:` is set, renders a `Chain` column (`candidate → fallback`) with `single-shot`, `escalation`, `effective cost`, `latency`, `score`. Edge case `candidate == fallback` renders as a single model and `—` in the escalation column, with retry injection skipped entirely so `effective == single-shot` by construction, not by coincidence.
- **`context[:retry_policy_override]`** — new context key that nullifies or replaces class-level `retry_policy` for a single call. Used internally by production-mode injection; safe to use directly when you need a transient override that doesn't mutate the step class.

### Scope

- Single-fallback (2-tier) chains only. Multi-tier chains can be inspected post-hoc via `trace.attempts` but aren't summarized in the optimize table.
- Costs with `runs: 3 + production_mode: { fallback: "gpt-5-mini" }` are ≈3× a single-shot eval plus the actual retry attempts — not 6×. Production-mode metrics come from a single pass.
- **Step-only.** Calling `compare_models` with `production_mode:` on a `Pipeline::Base` subclass raises `ArgumentError` — retry injection is Step-level and pipeline-wide fallback semantics aren't defined yet. Benchmark individual steps.

### Documentation

- **Guide: [Production-mode cost measurement](docs/guide/optimizing_retry_policy.md#production-mode-cost-measurement)** — API, metric interpretation, 2-tier scope note.

## 0.6.3 (2026-04-20)

### Features

- **`runs:` parameter on `compare_models` and `optimize_retry_policy`** — runs each candidate N times per eval and aggregates the mean score, mean cost per run, and mean latency. Reduces sampling variance in live mode where LLM outputs are non-deterministic (gpt-5 family enforces `temperature=1.0` server-side, so a single unlucky sample can misclassify a viable candidate as "failing"). Default `runs: 1` — backward compatible.
- **`RUNS=N` on `rake ruby_llm_contract:optimize`** — CLI flag for variance-aware optimization.
- **`Eval::AggregatedReport`** — duck-type `Report` exposing `score` (mean), `score_min`/`score_max` (spread), `total_cost` (mean per run), `pass_rate` (clean-pass count x/N), and `clean_passes`.
- **Guide: [Reducing variance with `runs:`](docs/guide/optimizing_retry_policy.md#reducing-variance-with-runs)** — when to use it and why.

## 0.6.2 (2026-04-18)

### Features

- **`Step.optimize_retry_policy`** — runs `compare_models` on ALL evals for the step, builds a score matrix, identifies the constraining eval, and suggests a retry chain. Chain's last model always passes all evals (safe fallback).
- **`rake ruby_llm_contract:optimize`** — one-command retry chain optimization. Prints score table, constraining eval, suggested chain, and copy-paste DSL.
- **Offline by default** — `optimize` uses `sample_response` (zero API calls) unless `LIVE=1` or `PROVIDER=` is set.
- **`EVAL_DIRS=` support** — non-Rails setups can specify eval file directories.
- **Guide: [Optimizing retry_policy](docs/guide/optimizing_retry_policy.md)** — full procedure with prerequisites, troubleshooting, and real-world example.

### Fixes

- Chain semantics aligned with `retry_executor` — retry fires on `validation_failed`/`parse_error`, not on low eval score. Disjoint eval coverage (A passes e1, B passes e2, neither passes both) correctly returns empty chain.
- Removed ActiveSupport dependency from rake task (`.presence` → `.empty?`).
- Added `require "set"` for non-Rails environments.

## 0.6.1 (2026-04-17)

### Features

- **Multi-provider operator tooling** — rake tasks support `PROVIDER=openai|anthropic|ollama`, `CANDIDATES=model@effort,...`, and `REASONING_EFFORT=low|medium|high`.
- **`rake ruby_llm_contract:recommend`** — wraps `Step.recommend` with CLI interface, prints best config, retry chain, DSL, rationale, and savings.
- **Ollama support** — `PROVIDER=ollama` with configurable `OLLAMA_API_BASE`.

## 0.6.0 (2026-04-12)

"What should I do?" — model + configuration recommendation.

### Features

- **`Step.recommend`** — `ClassifyTicket.recommend("eval", candidates: [...], min_score: 0.95)` runs eval on all candidates and returns a `Recommendation` with optimal model, retry chain, rationale, savings vs current config, and `to_dsl` code output.
- **Candidates as configurations** — `candidates:` accepts `{ model:, reasoning_effort: }` hashes, not just model name strings. `gpt-5-mini` with `reasoning_effort: "low"` is a different candidate than with `"high"`.
- **`compare_models` extended** — new `candidates:` parameter alongside existing `models:` (backward compatible). Candidate labels include reasoning effort in output table.
- **Per-attempt `reasoning_effort` in retry policies** — `escalate` accepts config hashes: `escalate({ model: "gpt-4.1-nano" }, { model: "gpt-5-mini", reasoning_effort: "high" })`. Each attempt gets its own reasoning_effort forwarded to the provider.
- **`pass_rate_ratio`** — numeric float (0.0–1.0) on `Report` and `ReportStats`, complementing the string `pass_rate` (`"3/5"`).
- **History entries enriched** — `save_history!` accepts `reasoning_effort:` and stores `model`, `reasoning_effort`, `pass_rate_ratio` in JSONL entries.

### Game changer continuity

```
v0.2: "Which model?"          → compare_models (snapshot)
v0.3: "Did it change?"        → baseline regression (binary)
v0.4: "Show me the trend"     → eval history (time series)
v0.5: "Which prompt is better?" → compare_with (A/B testing)
v0.6: "What should I do?"     → recommend (actionable advice)
```

## 0.5.2 (2026-04-06)

### Features

- **`reasoning_effort` forwarded to provider** — `context: { reasoning_effort: "low" }` now passed through `with_params` to the LLM. Previously accepted as a known context key but silently ignored by the RubyLLM adapter.

## 0.5.0 (2026-03-25)

Data-Driven Prompt Engineering.

### Features

- **`observe` DSL** — soft observations that log but never fail. `observe("scores differ") { |o| o[:a] != o[:b] }`. Results in `result.observations`. Logged via `Contract.logger` when they fail. Runs only when validation passes.
- **`compare_with`** — prompt A/B testing. `StepV2.compare_with(StepV1, eval: "regression", model: "nano")` returns `PromptDiff` with `improvements`, `regressions`, `score_delta`, `safe_to_switch?`. Reuses `BaselineDiff` internally.
- **RSpec `compared_with` chain** — `expect(StepV2).to pass_eval("x").compared_with(StepV1).without_regressions` blocks merge if new prompt regresses any case.

### Game changer continuity

```
v0.2: "Which model?"          → compare_models (snapshot)
v0.3: "Did it change?"        → baseline regression (binary)
v0.4: "Show me the trend"     → eval history (time series)
v0.5: "Which prompt is better?" → compare_with (A/B testing)
```

## 0.4.5 (2026-03-24)

Audit hardening — 18 bugs fixed across 4 audit rounds.

### Fixes

- **RakeTask history before abort** — `track_history` now saves all reports (pass and fail) before gating, so failed runs appear in eval history.
- **RSpec/Minitest stub scoping** — block form `stub_step` uses thread-local overrides with real cleanup. Non-block `stub_all_steps` auto-restored by RSpec `around(:each)` hook and Minitest `setup`/`teardown`.
- **StepAdapterOverride** — handles `context: nil` and respects string key `"adapter"`. Moved to `contract.rb` so both test frameworks share one mechanism.
- **max_cost fail closed output estimate** — preflight uses 1x input tokens as output estimate when `max_output` not set, preventing cost bypass for output-expensive models.
- **reset_configuration! clears overrides** — `step_adapter_overrides` now cleared on reset.
- **CostCalculator.register_model** — validates `Numeric`, `finite?`, non-negative. Rejects NaN, Infinity, strings, nil.
- **Pipeline token_budget** — rejects negative and zero values (parity with `timeout_ms`).
- **track_history model fallback** — uses step DSL `model`, then `default_model` when context has no model. Handles string key `"model"`.
- **estimate_cost / estimate_eval_cost** — falls back to step DSL model when no explicit model arg given.
- **stub_steps string keys** — both RSpec and Minitest normalize string-keyed options with `transform_keys(:to_sym)`.
- **DSL `:default` reset** — `model(:default)`, `temperature(:default)`, `max_cost(:default)` reset inherited parent values.

## 0.4.4 (2026-03-24)

- **`stub_steps` (plural)** — stub multiple steps with different responses in one block. No nesting needed. Works in RSpec and Minitest:
  ```ruby
  stub_steps(
    ClassifyTicket => { response: { priority: "high" } },
    RouteToTeam => { response: { team: "billing" } }
  ) { TicketPipeline.run("test") }
  ```

## 0.4.3 (2026-03-24)

Production feedback release.

### Features

- **`stub_step` block form** — `stub_step(Step, response: x) { test }` auto-resets adapter after block. Works in RSpec and Minitest. Eliminates leaked test state.
- **Minitest per-step routing** — `stub_step(StepA, ...)` now actually routes to StepA only (was setting global adapter, ignoring step class).
- **`track_history` in RakeTask** — `t.track_history = true` auto-appends every eval run (pass and fail) to `.eval_history/`. Drift detection without manual `save_history!` calls.
- **`max_cost` fail closed** — unknown model pricing now refuses the call instead of silently skipping. Set `on_unknown_pricing: :warn` for old behavior.
- **`CostCalculator.register_model`** — register pricing for custom/fine-tuned models: `register_model("ft:gpt-4o", input_per_1m: 3.0, output_per_1m: 6.0)`.

## 0.4.2 (2026-03-24)

- **RakeTask lazy context** — `t.context` now accepts a Proc, resolved at task runtime (after `:environment`). Fixes adapter not being available at Rake load time in Rails apps.

## 0.4.1 (2026-03-24)

- **RakeTask `:environment` fix** — uses `defined?(::Rails)` instead of `Rake::Task.task_defined?(:environment)`. Works in Rails 8 without manual `Rake::Task.enhance`.
- **Concurrent eval deterministic** — `clone_for_concurrency` protocol, `ContextHelpers` extracted.
- **README** — added eval history, concurrency, quality tracking examples.

## 0.4.0 (2026-03-24)

Observability & Scale — see what changed, run it fast, debug it easily.

### Features

- **Structured logging** — `Contract.configure { |c| c.logger = Rails.logger }`. Auto-logs model, status, latency, tokens, cost on every `step.run`.
- **Batch eval concurrency** — `run_eval("regression", concurrency: 4)`. Parallel case execution via Concurrent::Future. 4x faster CI for large eval suites.
- **Eval history & trending** — `report.save_history!` appends to JSONL. `report.eval_history` returns `EvalHistory` with `score_trend`, `drift?`, run-by-run scores.
- **Pipeline per-step eval** — `add_case(..., step_expectations: { classify: { priority: "high" } })`. See which step in a pipeline regressed.
- **Minitest support** — `assert_satisfies_contract`, `assert_eval_passes`, `stub_step` for Minitest users. `require "ruby_llm/contract/minitest"`.

### Game changer continuity

```
v0.2: "Which model?"          → compare_models (snapshot)
v0.3: "Did it change?"        → baseline regression (binary)
v0.4: "Show me the trend"     → eval history (time series)
      "Which step changed?"   → pipeline per-step eval
      "Run it fast"           → batch concurrency
```

## 0.3.7 (2026-03-24)

- **Trait missing key = error** — `expected_traits: { title: 0..5 }` on output `{}` now fails instead of silently passing.
- **nil input in dynamic prompts** — `run(nil)` with `prompt { |input| ... }` correctly passes nil to block.
- **Defensive sample pre-validation** — `sample_response` uses the same parser as runtime (handles code fences, BOM, prose around JSON).
- **Baseline diff excludes skipped** — self-compare with skipped cases no longer shows artificial score delta.
- **Zeitwerk eval/ ignore** — `eager_load_contract_dirs!` ignores `eval/` subdirs before eager load.

## 0.3.6 (2026-03-24)

- **Recursive array/object validation** — nested arrays (`array of array of string`) validated recursively. Object items validated even without `:properties` (e.g. `additionalProperties: false`).
- **Deep symbolize in sample pre-validation** — array samples with string keys (`[{"name" => "Alice"}]`) correctly symbolized before schema validation.

## 0.3.5 (2026-03-24)

- **String constraints in SchemaValidator** — `minLength`/`maxLength` enforced for root and nested strings.
- **Array item validation** — scalar items (string, integer) validated against items schema type and constraints.
- **Non-JSON sample_response fails fast** — `sample_response("hello")` with object schema raises ArgumentError at definition time instead of silently passing.
- **`max_tokens` in KNOWN_CONTEXT_KEYS** — no more spurious "Unknown context keys" warning.
- **Duplicate models deduplicated** — `compare_models(models: ["m", "m"])` runs model once.

## 0.3.4 (2026-03-24)

- **SchemaValidator validates non-object roots** — boolean, integer, number, array root schemas now enforce type, min/max, enum, minItems/maxItems. Previously only object schemas were validated.
- **Removed passing cases = regression** — `regressed?` returns true when baseline had passing cases that are now missing. Prevents gate bypass by deleting eval cases.
- **JSON string sample_response fixed** — `sample_response('{"name":"Alice"}')` correctly parsed for pre-validation instead of double-encoding.
- **`context[:max_tokens]` forwarded** — overrides step's `max_output` for adapter call AND budget precheck.

## 0.3.3 (2026-03-23)

- **Skipped cases visible in regression diff** — baseline PASS → current SKIP now detected as regression by `without_regressions` and `fail_on_regression`.
- **Skip only on missing adapter** — eval runner no longer masks evaluator errors as SKIP. Only "No adapter configured" triggers skip.
- **Array/Hash sample pre-validation** — `sample_response([{...}])` correctly validated against schema instead of silently skipping.
- **`assume_model_exists: false` forwarded** — boolean `false` no longer dropped by truthiness check in adapter options.
- **Duplicate case names caught at definition** — `add_case`/`verify` with same name raises immediately, not at run time.

## 0.3.2 (2026-03-23)

- **Array response preserved** — `Adapters::RubyLLM` no longer stringifies Array content. Steps with `output_type Array` work correctly.
- **Falsy prompt input** — `run(false)` and `build_messages(false)` pass `false` to dynamic prompt blocks instead of falling back to `instance_eval`.
- **`retry_on` flatten** — `retry_on([:a, :b])` no longer wraps in nested array.
- **Builder reset** — `Prompt::Builder` resets nodes on each build (no accumulation on reuse).
- **Pipeline false output** — `output: false` no longer shows "(no output)" in pretty_print.

## 0.3.1 (2026-03-23)

Fixes from persona_tool production deployment (4 services migrated).

- **Proc/Lambda in `expected_traits`** — `expected_traits: { score: ->(v) { v > 3 } }` now works.
- **Zeitwerk eager-load** — `load_evals!` eager-loads `app/contracts/` and `app/steps/` before loading eval files. Fixes uninitialized constant errors in Rake tasks.
- **Falsy values** — `expected: false`, `input: false`, `sample_response(nil)` all handled correctly.
- **Context key forwarding** — `provider:` and `assume_model_exists:` forwarded to adapter. `schema:` and `max_tokens:` are step-level only (no split-brain).
- **Deep-freeze immutability** — constructors never mutate caller's data.

## 0.3.0 (2026-03-23)

Baseline regression detection — know when quality drops before users do.

### Features

- **`report.save_baseline!`** — serialize eval results to `.eval_baselines/` (JSON, git-tracked)
- **`report.compare_with_baseline`** — returns `BaselineDiff` with regressions, improvements, score_delta, new/removed cases
- **`diff.regressed?`** — true when any previously-passing case now fails
- **`without_regressions` RSpec chain** — `expect(Step).to pass_eval("x").without_regressions`
- **RakeTask `fail_on_regression`** — blocks CI when regressions detected
- **RakeTask `save_baseline`** — auto-save after successful run
- **Migration guide** — `docs/guide/migration.md` with 7 patterns for adopting the gem in existing Rails apps

### Stats

- 1086 tests, 0 failures

## 0.2.3 (2026-03-23)

Production hardening from senior Rails review panel.

- **`around_call` propagates exceptions** — no longer silently swallows DB errors, timeouts, etc. User who wants swallowing can rescue in their block.
- **Nil section content skipped** — `section "X", nil` no longer renders `"null"` to the LLM. Section is omitted entirely.
- **Range support in `expected:`** — `expected: { score: 1..5 }` works in `add_case`. Previously only Regexp was supported.
- **`Trace#dig`** — `trace.dig(:usage, :input_tokens)` works on both Step and Pipeline traces.

## 0.2.2 (2026-03-23)

Fixes from first real-world integration (persona_tool).

- **`around_call` fires per-run** — not per-attempt. With retry_policy, callback fires once with final result. Signature: `around_call { |step, input, result| ... }`
- **`Result#trace` always `Trace` object** — never bare Hash. `result.trace.model` works on success AND failure.
- **`around_call` exception safe** — warns and returns result instead of crashing.
- **`model` DSL** — `model "gpt-4o-mini"` per-step. Priority: context > step DSL > global config.
- **Test adapter `raw_output` always String** — Hash/Array normalized to `.to_json`.
- **`Trace#dig`** — `trace.dig(:usage, :input_tokens)` works.

## 0.2.1 (2026-03-23)

Production DX improvements from first real-world integration (persona_tool).

### Features

- **`temperature` DSL** — `temperature 0.3` in step definition, overridable via `context: { temperature: 0.7 }`. RubyLLM handles per-model normalization natively.
- **`around_call` hook** — callback for logging, metrics, observability. Replaces need for custom middleware.
- **`build_messages` public** — inspect rendered prompt without running the step.
- **`stub_step` RSpec helper** — `stub_step(MyStep, response: { ... })` reduces test boilerplate. Auto-included via `require "ruby_llm/contract/rspec"`.
- **`estimate_cost` / `estimate_eval_cost`** — predict spend before API calls.

### Fixes

- **Reload lifecycle** — `load_evals!` clears definitions before re-loading. Railtie hooks `config.to_prepare` for development reload. `define_eval` warns on duplicate name (suppressed during reload).
- **Pipeline eval cost** — uses `Pipeline::Trace#total_cost` (all steps), not just last step.
- **Adapter isolation** — `compare_models` and `run_all_own_evals` deep-dup context per run.
- **Offline mode** — cases without adapter return `:skipped` instead of crashing. Skipped cases excluded from score.
- **`expected_traits`** reachable from `define_eval` DSL via `add_case`.
- **`verify`** raises when both positional and `expect:` keyword provided.
- **`best_for`** excludes zero-score models from recommendation.
- **`print_summary`** replaces `pretty_print` (avoids `Kernel#pretty_print` shadow).
- **`CaseResult#to_h`** round-trips correctly (`name:` key).

### Docs

- All 5 guides updated for v0.2 API
- Symbol keys documented
- Retry model priority documented
- Test adapter format documented

### Stats

- 1077 tests, 0 failures
- 3 architecture review rounds, 32 findings fixed

## 0.2.0 (2026-03-23)

Contracts for LLM quality. Know which model to use, what it costs, and when accuracy drops.

### Breaking changes

- **`report.results` returns `CaseResult` objects** instead of hashes. Use `result.name`, `result.passed?`, `result.score` instead of `result[:case_name]`, `result[:passed]`. `CaseResult#to_h` for backward compat.
- **`report.print_summary`** replaces `report.pretty_print` (avoids shadowing `Kernel#pretty_print`).

### Features

- **`add_case` in `define_eval`** — `add_case "billing", input: "...", expected: { priority: "high" }` with partial matching. Supports `expected_traits:` for regex/range matching.
- **`CaseResult` value objects** — `result.name`, `result.passed?`, `result.output`, `result.expected`, `result.mismatches` (structured diff), `result.cost`, `result.duration_ms`.
- **`report.failures`** — returns only failed cases. `report.skipped` counts skipped (offline) cases.
- **Model comparison** — `Step.compare_models("eval", models: %w[nano mini full])` runs same eval across models. Returns table with score/cost/latency per model. `comparison.best_for(min_score: 0.95)` returns cheapest model meeting threshold.
- **Cost tracking** — `report.total_cost`, `report.avg_latency_ms`, per-case `result.cost`. Pipeline eval uses total pipeline cost, not just last step.
- **Cost prediction** — `Step.estimate_cost(input:, model:)` and `Step.estimate_eval_cost("eval", models: [...])` predict spend before API calls.
- **CI gating** — `pass_eval("regression").with_minimum_score(0.8).with_maximum_cost(0.01)`. RakeTask with suite-level `minimum_score` and `maximum_cost`.
- **`RubyLLM::Contract.run_all_evals`** — discovers all Steps/Pipelines with evals, runs them all. Includes inherited evals.
- **`RubyLLM::Contract::RakeTask`** — `rake ruby_llm_contract:eval` with `minimum_score`, `maximum_cost`, `fail_on_empty`, `eval_dirs`.
- **Rails Railtie** — auto-loads eval files via `config.after_initialize` + `config.to_prepare` (supports development reload).
- **Offline mode** — cases without adapter return `:skipped` instead of crashing. Skipped cases excluded from score/passed.
- **Safe `define_eval`** — warns on duplicate name; suppressed during reload.

### Fixes

- **P1: Eval files not autoloaded by Rails** — Railtie uses `load` (not Zeitwerk). Hooks into reloader for dev.
- **P2: report.results returns raw Hashes** — now returns `CaseResult` objects.
- **P3: No way to run all evals at once** — `Contract.run_all_evals` + Rake task.
- **P4: String vs symbol key mismatch** — warns when `validate` or `verify` proc returns nil.
- **Pipeline eval cost** — uses `Pipeline::Trace#total_cost` (all steps), not just last step.
- **Reload lifecycle** — `load_evals!` clears definitions before re-loading. Registry filters stale hosts.
- **Adapter isolation** — `compare_models` and `run_all_own_evals` deep-dup context per run.
